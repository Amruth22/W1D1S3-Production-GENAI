### Meeting Minutes

**[9:00 AM] Rachel Foster:** Thank you all for joining on short notice. We have a critical situation with yesterday's ProductX 3.0 launch. Tom, please brief everyone on what we've discovered.

**[9:02 AM] Tom Bradley:** We've identified three critical issues since launch. First, users on Windows machines are experiencing crashes when importing files larger than 100MB. Second, the payment processing module is double-charging some customers. Third, the data export feature is corrupting CSV files. We've received 847 support tickets since midnight.

**[9:04 AM] Alex Kumar:** This is unacceptable. How did these issues pass QA?

**[9:05 AM] Tom Bradley:** The Windows issue only occurs with a specific combination of Windows 11 and certain antivirus software - this combination wasn't in our test matrix. The payment issue appears to be an edge case with international transactions. The CSV problem... that's on us. We missed it.

**[9:07 AM] James Liu:** My team has been working through the night. We have patches ready for the CSV issue and the Windows crash. The payment bug is more complex - we need another 4-6 hours.

**[9:09 AM] Maria Gonzalez:** Alex, we need to make a decision about whether to roll back the entire release. We're getting hammered on social media. Our NPS score has dropped 15 points overnight.

**[9:11 AM] Alex Kumar:** What's our exposure on the payment issue?

**[9:12 AM] Maria Gonzalez:** We've identified 43 customers who were double-charged, totaling approximately $12,000 in overcharges. My team is preparing refunds, but we need to act fast.

**[9:14 AM] Derek Wilson:** From a legal standpoint, we need to notify affected customers within 24 hours of discovery. We should also consider offering compensation beyond just refunds to prevent any potential litigation.

**[9:15 AM] Sophie Martin:** *[Joining late]* Sorry for the delay. I've been pulling data - we're seeing a 34% increase in churn risk signals from our enterprise customers.

**[9:17 AM] Rachel Foster:** This changes things. Nina, what's our communication strategy?

**[9:18 AM] Nina Patel:** I recommend full transparency. We should send an email to all users within the next hour acknowledging the issues, outlining our fix timeline, and offering compensation. I've drafted a press release, but I strongly suggest we fix at least two of the three issues before it goes out.

**[9:20 AM] Alex Kumar:** James, if we implement the two ready patches now, what's the risk?

**[9:22 AM] James Liu:** Minimal. We can hot-patch the CSV and Windows issues without taking the system down. Users will need to refresh their sessions, but that's it. The payment fix will require a 30-minute maintenance window.

**[9:24 AM] Rachel Foster:** Let's do it. James, deploy the two patches immediately. Schedule the payment fix for 3 PM Pacific when usage is lowest.

**[9:26 AM] Maria Gonzalez:** What about compensation? I propose we offer affected users a free month of service and a 25% discount on their next renewal.

**[9:28 AM] Derek Wilson:** That's reasonable. For the double-charged customers, I recommend an additional 50% credit on top of the full refund.

**[9:30 AM] Alex Kumar:** Approved. But I want a full post-mortem next week. This can't happen again.

**[9:32 AM] Tom Bradley:** I'll lead the post-mortem. We're already documenting everything. Preliminary finding: our test coverage was only 76% for the payment module. We need to hit 95% minimum.

**[9:34 AM] Rachel Foster:** Agreed. Let's talk immediate actions. Maria, how quickly can your team process the refunds?

**[9:35 AM] Maria Gonzalez:** We'll have all refunds processed by noon today. I've pulled in extra staff from the sales team to help with customer outreach.

**[9:37 AM] Nina Patel:** I need final approval on the customer communication. I'm sending it to everyone now... check your emails.

**[9:39 AM] Alex Kumar:** *[After reviewing]* Good, but add a personal note from me at the beginning. Something like: "I personally apologize for the inconvenience. We fell short of our standards, and we're taking immediate action."

**[9:41 AM] Nina Patel:** Will do. Sending in 30 minutes?

**[9:42 AM] Rachel Foster:** Yes. James, status on the patches?

**[9:43 AM] James Liu:** First patch is deployed. Windows crash fix going live in... deployed. Both patches are live. Early metrics show the issues are resolved.

**[9:45 AM] Sophie Martin:** I'm seeing positive signals already. Support ticket velocity is decreasing.

**[9:47 AM] Rachel Foster:** Good. Let's discuss the elephant in the room - do we delay the European launch scheduled for next week?

**[9:49 AM] Alex Kumar:** What's everyone's thoughts?

**[9:50 AM] Tom Bradley:** I strongly recommend a two-week delay. We need comprehensive testing with European payment providers.

**[9:52 AM] Maria Gonzalez:** I agree. Better to delay than to have these issues repeat in a new market.

**[9:54 AM] James Liu:** My team needs those two weeks anyway. We've been in crunch mode for a month.

**[9:56 AM] Alex Kumar:** Decision made. Delay the European launch to August 25th. Nina, make sure our European partners are notified personally, not through a mass email.

**[9:58 AM] Nina Patel:** I'll handle those calls personally this afternoon.

**[10:00 AM] Rachel Foster:** Let's wrap up with assignments. Everyone clear on their immediate actions?
