### Meeting Minutes

**[2:00 PM] Sarah Chen:** Good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin our Q3 planning session. I'd like to start with a quick review of our Q2 performance. David, could you share the financial highlights?

**[2:02 PM] David Thompson:** Certainly. We ended Q2 with revenues at $4.2 million, which is 8% above our target. Operating expenses came in at $3.1 million, giving us a healthy margin of 26%. Our cash position remains strong at $12 million.

**[2:05 PM] Lisa Wang:** I'd like to add that from a sales perspective, we closed 47 new enterprise accounts in Q2, exceeding our target of 40. The average deal size increased by 15% to $89,000.

**[2:07 PM] Sarah Chen:** Excellent results. Now, let's discuss our Q3 objectives. Based on the board's guidance, we need to focus on three key areas: product innovation, market expansion, and operational efficiency. Michael, what's the status on the product roadmap?

**[2:10 PM] Michael Rodriguez:** We have three major releases planned for Q3. First, the AI-powered analytics dashboard will launch in early September. Second, the mobile app redesign is scheduled for mid-October. Third, we're introducing the enterprise API by the end of November. My team needs additional resources for the API project - we're looking at hiring two senior developers.

**[2:14 PM] Sarah Chen:** Noted. Let's discuss that in the budget allocation section. Jennifer, what's the marketing strategy to support these launches?

**[2:15 PM] Jennifer Park:** We're planning a multi-channel campaign. For the analytics dashboard, we'll run a webinar series starting August 20th. We've already secured three industry influencers as speakers. For the mobile app, we're focusing on user-generated content and a referral program. The enterprise API will be promoted through direct outreach and a presence at TechCon in November.

**[2:18 PM] Robert Johnson:** I have a concern about the implementation timeline. My operations team needs at least two weeks for testing before each release. Are these dates accounting for that?

**[2:20 PM] Michael Rodriguez:** Good point, Robert. The dates I mentioned are for production release. We'll have staging versions ready two weeks prior for your team's testing.

**[2:22 PM] Sarah Chen:** Perfect. Now let's talk budget. David, what's our Q3 allocation looking like?

**[2:23 PM] David Thompson:** We have $3.4 million allocated for Q3 operations. Breaking it down: $1.8 million for salaries and benefits, $600,000 for marketing, $400,000 for R&D, $300,000 for infrastructure, and $300,000 as contingency.

**[2:26 PM] Michael Rodriguez:** I'd like to request an additional $150,000 from the contingency fund for the two developer positions I mentioned.

**[2:28 PM] Lisa Wang:** Before we allocate that, I think we should consider investing more in sales enablement. We're seeing longer sales cycles for enterprise deals, and additional training could help.

**[2:30 PM] Sarah Chen:** Valid points from both of you. David, can we accommodate both requests?

**[2:32 PM] David Thompson:** If we allocate $150,000 for engineering and $50,000 for sales enablement, we'd still have $100,000 in contingency. I'm comfortable with that buffer.

**[2:34 PM] Sarah Chen:** All in favor? 
*[General agreement from all attendees]*

**[2:35 PM] Sarah Chen:** Motion carried. Let's move to discussing our expansion into the European market. Lisa, you've been leading this initiative.

**[2:37 PM] Lisa Wang:** Yes, we've identified Germany and the UK as our primary targets. We'll need to address GDPR compliance, which Michael's team is already working on. I'm proposing we hire a European sales director by the end of Q3 to lead the expansion in Q4.

**[2:40 PM] Jennifer Park:** Marketing will need localized content. I estimate we'll need about $75,000 for translation and localization services.

**[2:42 PM] Michael Rodriguez:** On the technical side, we'll need to set up EU-based servers for data residency requirements. That's roughly $50,000 in initial setup costs.

**[2:45 PM] Sarah Chen:** These are significant investments. David, can we absorb these costs in Q3, or should we defer to Q4?

**[2:47 PM] David Thompson:** I recommend we start the groundwork in Q3 using existing budgets and request additional funding from the board for Q4. The ROI projections Lisa shared last week show break-even by Q2 2026.

**[2:50 PM] Sarah Chen:** Agreed. Let's prepare a formal proposal for the board's September meeting. Now, before we wrap up, let's review action items.
